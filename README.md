# CreateJS

# Why?

This is a package that contains the createjs library. I created this because the other createjs package on atmosphere did not have the recent version, documentation or a link to github, making it difficult to contribute.

# How

It works just like regular createjs, nothing special. See the docs [here](http://www.createjs.com/docs)

# Cool!

Thanks, I didn't make it but I hope it helps you. If you have any problems, please feel free to open an issue on github or even patch it yourself.
